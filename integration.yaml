#-------------------- General conventions -------------------#
# 1. All successful responses should be returned with 200 HTTP status code
# 2. If input params in request are not correct, #ApiErrorBadRequest entity should be returned with 400 HTTP code
# 3. If unexpected error occurred, #ApiErrorServerError entity should be returned with 500 HTTP code
# 4. For single-entity requests (like getItemById) #ApiErrorEntityNotFound should be returned with 404 HTTP code
# 5. For multiple-entity requests (like getItemByIds) empty list should be returned if nothing found (not 404)
# 6. Events model not used in API, such events should be provided by any queue-like tool (Kafka, for example)
